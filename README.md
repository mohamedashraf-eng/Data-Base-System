___

## Technicalities 
All about software

### Data Structures
Data structured is built as generic indebendent library in this project.

* Data structure:
  * Doubly Linked Lists.   
  * Linear Standard Queue.
  * Linear Priority Queue.
  * Linear Standard Stack.
  * Standard Tree. 
  * Binary Tree.

### Algorithms
Algorithms is buildtas generic indebendent library in this project.

* Algorithms:
    * Sorting:
        * Merge Sort.
    * Searching:
        * Linear Search.
        * Binary Search.  
        * BT Search.
